# pacmanecs
This is a simple example of PacMan-game using Entity-Component-System implementation [LeoECS](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs). \
It's a fine example of how to use the Leopotam ECS framework and how to use itself ECS architecture in your Unity game.\
Be aware, the project has no best practices and **must be used only as an example, not as a guide**!
